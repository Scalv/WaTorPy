An implementation of Wa-Tor ([Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa-Tor)).

## A Simple Simulation
Intended to model simple behavior of sharks and fish in a donut shaped world,
WaTorPy involves fish breeding and sharks eating or dying.

Adjust settings to try and develop an equilibrium between sharks and fish.

## Usage
Change settings from the menu can be used to change aspects of the Simulation
to your liking. Start will start the simulation, set up autostep to move
through steps quickly.
